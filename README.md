## Resources

*   Visual Studio Code Version: 1.105.0 (Universal)
*   Java: openJDK version 17.0.16
*   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46874944/what-is-byte-data-type-in-java-and-why-it-is-used

## Revision Changes
*   Added Javadocs to methods
*   Added style changes to align more with what is expected.
    (There are a few lines where there are more than 100 characters, but it doesn't make much sense to break them down into multiple lines
    so please take that into consideration if the autograder isn't happy with the styling for such reasons.)
